# [W3 Resource Python Basics 2](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/w3resourceBasicPython2/tree/main/w3schoolbasics2)

* This repo is a continuation of the last basic python repo on my acccount. I have struggled with coding by myself despite taking a couple classes, these programs within this repo are apart of the w3 schools basic python 2 program. They have been essential in helping me practice my skills and build confidence while learning programming. This Repo is still a work in progress and there will be a lot more programs added to this, but for now I have finished the first 35 programs from this pratice.
